# Desktop Wallpeper

This repo contains some desktop wallpapers that I made. Not all of them are good.

## how to use

You just clone this repo, or download one of the wallpapers by itself and set it as your desktop wallpaper. The process of setting the wallpaper is OS and DE (desktop environment) specific, so you'll have to figure that out yourself.
