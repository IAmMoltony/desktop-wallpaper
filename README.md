# desktop wallpaper

This repo contains some desktop wallpapers that I made. Some are awful, which is
by design.

## `make-symlinks.sh`

This is a shell script that automatically creates symlinks to desktop wallpaper from
this repository to literally anywhere. Example:

```bash
$ ~/Downloads/desktop-wallpaper/make-symlinks.sh
'./arch.png' -> '/home/moltony/Downloads/desktop-walpaper/arch/arch.png
...etc...
```

## how to use

You just clone this repo, or download one of the wallpapers by itself and set it
as your desktop wallpaper. The process of setting the wallpaper is OS and DE
(desktop environment) specific, so you'll have to figure that out yourself.

GIMP XCF files are also provided if you want to make changes to the wallpapers (asterisk).

### asterisk

`babanya` doesn't have the xcf file because I did not save the XCF file, only
exported it.

For `azubananya` I did save the XCF file but I deleted it accidentally. oop ðŸ¥ºðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

## contributing

Contributions very welcome, everyone. Issues and pull requests, you know, the usual.

I also kindly ask not to submit a pull request with a new wallpaper not originally
designed by me. Adding variants or modifying the existing wallpapers to address
mistakes is fine, though.

## infrequently asked questions

### why 1366x768

Because this is the screen resolution of both my laptop and my pc. I might add
more resolution options in the future if I need to. (asterisk 2)

#### asterisk 2

`azubananya` doesn't follow this arbitrary rule since uhh idk
