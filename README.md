# desktop wallpaper

This repo contains some desktop wallpapers that I made, some of which are purposefully awful.

## how to use

You just clone this repo, or download one of the wallpapers by itself and set it as your desktop wallpaper. The process of setting the wallpaper is OS and DE (desktop environment) specific, so you'll have to figure that out yourself.

GIMP XCF files are also provided if you want to make changes to the wallpapers (aterisk).

### asterisk

`babanya` doesn't have the xcf file because I did not save the XCF file, only exported it.

For `azubananya` I did save the XCF file but I deleted it accidentally. oop ðŸ¥ºðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

## why 1366x768

Because this is the screen resolution of both my laptop and my pc. I might add more resolution options in the future. (asterisk)

### asterisk

`azubananya` doesn't follow this arbitrary rule since uhh idk
