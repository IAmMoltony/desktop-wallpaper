# desktop wallpaper

This repo contains some desktop wallpapers that I made. Some are awful, which is
by design.

## how to use

You just clone this repo, or download one of the wallpapers by itself and set it
as your desktop wallpaper. The process of setting the wallpaper is OS and DE
(desktop environment) specific, so you'll have to figure that out yourself.

XCF (GIMP) and Blend (Blender) files are also provided if you want to make
changes to the wallpapers (asterisk).

### asterisk

`babanya` doesn't have the xcf file because I did not save the XCF file, only
exported it.

For `azubananya` I did save the XCF file but I deleted it accidentally. oop 🥺👉👈

## `make-symlinks.sh`

This is a shell script that automatically creates symlinks to desktop wallpaper from
this repository to literally anywhere. Example:

```bash
$ ~/Downloads/desktop-wallpaper/make-symlinks.sh
'./arch.png' -> '/home/moltony/Downloads/desktop-walpaper/arch/arch.png
...etc...
```

## contributing

Contributions very welcome, everyone. Issues and pull requests, you know, the usual.

I also kindly ask not to submit a pull request with a new wallpaper not originally
designed by me. Adding variants or modifying the existing wallpapers to address
mistakes is fine, though.

### tldr

You can use any of these wallpapers freely and create modifications. When
sharing, don't forget to credit.
